# Rainbow Fruit Bowl – GitHub Pages Site

This repo hosts a simple 3‑page static site for a fruit bowl business.

## Pages
- `index.html` – landing page
- `menu.html` – menu & ingredients
- `order.html` – WhatsApp order form
- `style.css` – shared styles
- `.nojekyll` – ensures GitHub Pages serves files as-is

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo named **rainbow-fruit-bowl** (or any name).
2. Upload all files from this folder to the root of the repo.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set *Source* to **Deploy from a branch**, and choose the `main` branch and `/root` folder. Save.
4. Your site will appear at the Pages URL shown there (something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/rainbow-fruit-bowl/`).

## Customize
- Replace the placeholder WhatsApp number in `order.html` (`adminNumber`) with your full international number (e.g., `91XXXXXXXXXX`).
- Tweak prices and items in `menu.html` and `order.html` as needed.
- Add your logo: swap the gradient square in the navbar with an image.
